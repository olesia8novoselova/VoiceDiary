## 🎯 Objective

The goal of the ML component is to accurately detect emotions in users' voice recordings and extract meaningful summaries from the transcribed text. The insights are used to track emotional patterns and provide helpful psychological feedback.


## 📦 Models Used

### 1. 📝 Whisper Large V3* - Transcription (Voice to Text)

We use **Whisper** models for transcribing user voice recordings into text. The choice of model depends on the language and desired balance between speed and accuracy.

#### 🧪 Experimental Findings

- **Whisper Small**: Very fast, but low accuracy. Suitable only for quick English transcriptions where quality is not critical.
- **Whisper Medium**: Good for English. Decent speed and reliable transcriptions. Sometimes picks up other languages, but language detection is often inaccurate.
- **Whisper Large V3**: High accuracy. Supports proper translation with the right settings. Slower, but offers robust multilingual capabilities.
- **Whisper Large V3 Turbo**: Optimized for speed, but translation support is limited or unavailable. Inconsistent speed – sometimes faster or slower than Medium. Our experiments show that it is not reliable for multilingual use.

> **Official multilingual support** is only available in **Large V3** and **Turbo** models.

#### 🚀 Current Strategy

1. **Use Whisper Large V3** for **language detection**, **transcription** and **translation** (if initially it is not in English)
---

#### 📊 Model Comparison

| Model       | Parameters | Multilingual | Recommended Use                         |
|-------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| small       | 244M       | ❌           | Very fast but inaccurate, English only   |
| medium      | 769M       | ❌           | Good for English, unreliable for others  |
| large-v3    | 1550M      | ✅           | High-quality multilingual transcription and translation |
| large-v3-turbo | 798M    | ✅           | Fast but limited translation, inconsistent results |

> All Whisper models are trained on over **680,000 hours** of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web.


The transcribed text is then forwarded to a text-based analysis module for tasks such as emotion extraction, summarization, and supportive feedback (currently under development).

### 2. 🎤 Fine-tuned Whisper Large V3 - Emotion Recognition from Voice (Speech Audio)

We use a **fine-tuned Whisper Large V3** model to classify emotions from raw voice recordings.

#### ⚙️ Preprocessing
- **Audio Loading**: Using Librosa to load `.wav` files.
- **Feature Extraction**: Whisper's feature extractor is applied for normalization and formatting.

#### 🧠 Model Details
- **Base Model**: `openai/whisper-large-v3`
- **Task**: Audio classification
- **Output**: Emotion labels (`Angry`, `Disgust`, `Fearful`, `Happy`, `Neutral`, `Sad`, `Surprised`)

> The **'calm'** emotion was excluded from training due to underrepresentation.

#### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
| Metric     | Value   |
|------------|---------|
| Loss       | 0.5008  |
| Accuracy   | 0.9199  |
| Precision  | 0.9230  |
| Recall     | 0.9199  |
| F1 Score   | 0.9198  |

> The model performs well in distinguishing between multiple emotional states in speech.

### 3. 💬 Fine-tuned BART-based model SAMSum - Text-Based summary
We use a **fine-tuned BART-based model** to generate short summaries from transcribed user voice recordings. This helps distill lengthy or unstructured speech into clear, meaningful insights — ideal for daily reflection and psychological tracking.

#### 🧪 Experimental Findings

We tested multiple summarization approaches and found that dialogue-optimized models provide significantly better results on spoken diary content.

- **BART Large (CNN)**: Trained for news articles — too formal, often misses conversational nuance.
- **T5**: Lightweight and fast, but inconsistent output for long or emotional speech.
- **BART SAMSum**: Specifically fine-tuned on conversational dialogues; excellent at summarizing emotional, informal, or reflective speech.

> `philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum` provided the best quality-to-speed tradeoff and handled diary-like entries very naturally.

#### 🚀 Current Strategy

To ensure **reliable summarization of user entries**, we follow this pipeline:
1. Transcribe audio using Whisper (see above).
2. Clean and normalize the resulting text.
3. Run the text through `philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum` to generate a concise 1–3 sentence summary.
4. Store/display this summary as the primary daily insight.

This ensures every diary entry receives a structured, emotionally-relevant summary — even when the original voice content is long or repetitive.

#### 📊 Model Comparison

| Model                          | Parameters | Trained For     | Summary Quality     | Suitable For Speech |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| bart-large-cnn                | 406M       | News articles    | Formal, often dry    | ❌                   |
| t5-small                      | 60M        | General purpose  | Fast, but weak       | ❌                   |
| **bart-large-cnn-samsum**     | 406M       | Dialogues        | ✅ Natural & concise | ✅ Yes               |

> SAMSum-trained BART is fine-tuned on thousands of real human conversations and summaries, making it ideal for user voice journals.

---

The generated summary is later used in downstream modules (e.g., LLM-based reflection, emotional feedback, future search/indexing).

> This summarization step is already **fully deployed and in active use** as part of the Voice Diary MVP.


### 4. 💭 j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base - Emotion Recognition from Text
